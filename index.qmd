## Welcome

This is the website for navigating Tools for Risk Scores in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (TRS-ABCD). Created by the Pelham Lab, TRS-ABCD provides researchers familiar with the ABCD study with practical tools to create predictive survey and / or screening models in the ABCD Study. If you do not already have access to the ABCD Study, you can request access to it through the National Institute of Health (NIH). For more information about the ABCD Study, click [here](https://abcdstudy.org/). You will need R to use TRS-ABCD.

To get started:

1.  If you don't already have it, obtain access to the ABCD 6.0 data (only available directly through the [NIH](https://www.nbdc-datahub.org/))
2.  Download the code repository. This code will take the ABCD Study 6.0 data and create a tidy dataframe with individual survey items ready to plug into a predictive model.

If you do not use R, you can still download our item metadata (metadata-ABCD-items.csv) to work on survey-based projects. The items in the metadata consist of the entirety of variables that could be presented on a survey with little to no context.
