    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\nIf you have a question that is not currently addressed here, please reach out to &lt;wpelham at ucsd dot edu&gt;.\n\nWill the code in abcd-itembuild work if I don’t have the ABCD Study data?\nNo, you must attain access to the ABCD 6.0 release (only available directly from the NIH) for the code to work. It is highly specific to the ABCD dataset.\n\n\nIs the code available in another programming language aside from R?\nNo, currently the only available code for this project is in R.\n\n\nHow did you create the metadata?\nPelham Lab research assistants evaluated the entirety of the metadata from the ABCD 6.0 release under the supervision of Dr. William Pelham III. Variables were first evaluated on the basis of viability as a question on a survey. If a variable could be a survey question, it was then evaluated on the following:\na) administration of the variable in the core study (such that all eligible ABCD participants could have completed the variable) ,\nb) administration of the variable happening outside of the eligibility screener,\nc) if gating is present, the variable’s ability to be combined with the gating question(s) to produce a straightforward single question with a single set of responses with a monotonic relationship with the outcomes , and\nd) any other reason that would make presenting the variable on a predictive screening battery difficult.\nColumns were also created to facilitate recoding potential items and also to sort/categorize the items.\nMore information on how we created the bespoke metadata can be found here.\n\n\nHow did you decide which variables to recode, and how to recode them?\nVariables were recoded for the following reasons:\n\nThe same variable was split into two or more separate variables: usually a baseline variable and a longitudinal variable. For example, the question “Has she/he [your child] ever been to a doctor for allergies” is asked at baseline, responses for which are stored in the variable ph_p_mhx_002. Following baseline, the question is rephrased as “Since we last saw you, has your child been to a doctor for allergies”, responses for which are stored in ph_p_mhx_002__l. Upon evaluating that there is no meaningful change in the contents of the question itself, these variables were combined into the baseline variable, after which we deleted the longitudinal variable.\nThe variable itself did not have responses that were monotonic (linear). For example, the question\nWhat best describes your child’s current school setting?\ncan only elicit responses that are not linear (e.g., “public school”, “private school”, “home school”, etc.). To be able to use the content of these variables in our prediction models, we recoded each response to these nonlinear variables as binary (0/1) items (e.g., child_in_reg_public_school, child_in_reg_private_school, child_in_online_school, etc.).\nThe variable was gated by another variable, such that only a subsection of the full ABCD participant pool responded to it AND answers from the gating question(s) could be imputed as responses to the gated variable. For example, the question “About how many hours per week does your child spend listening to music for pleasure?” is only presented to parents who endorse that their child listens to music for pleasure. We know, however, that parents who do not endorse that their child listens to music, if presented with the question, “About how many hours per week does your child spend listening to music for pleasure?” would have responded with “0 hours.” As such, we impute 0s for hours of music listening per week for people who responded “no” to the gating question.\nThe variable was in units that could not be adequately represented in a linear model (e.g., hours and minutes) without recoding (e.g., 3:30 pm –&gt; 15.5)\n\n\n\nWhere are the items measuring youth substance use?\nTSP-ABCD was initially conceptualized as a predictive tool for the outcome of high-risk, early substance use. As such, the lab prioritized evaluating whether variables could be considered items when they did not contain youth substance use. We are currently working on evaluating these variables and will update the metadata on this website once we have finished. Here is a spreadsheet containing all potential items flagged for youth substance use.\n\n\nI think there is a bug in your code or error in your metadata — what should I do?\nPlease report any bugs or errors to &lt; placeholder at health dot ucsd dot edu &gt;\n\n\nWhat is “ALEXSA” and why is it included in the metadata?\nAssessment of Liability and EXposure to Substance use and Antisocial behavior for Children (ALEXSA) assessment (Ridenour et al., 2009) is a child report assessment for predictors of early onset substance abuse and for antisocial behavior. The “alexsa_facet” featured in metadata-ABCD-items.csv was created through evaluating whether each item fit into one of the 34 subscales.\n\n\nHow do I acknowledge / cite this tool?\nTBD\n\n\nWhere can I read more about creating and evaluating predictive modeling tools?\nHere are some references!\nSteyerberg, E.

    "text": "What is this website?\nThis website describes a set of tools we created for developing prediction models and uncovering risk scores using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study release [6.0]\nHere are some examples of prediction models you might want to develop:\n\nPredict which children ages 9-10 will develop substance use problems by age 18\nPredict the level of depressive symptoms 12 months into the future\nPredict the probability of school dropout in each grade of high school\n\nThere are the sorts of tasks the tools are intended to help with.\n\n\nWhat do you mean by a “prediction model”?\n“Prediction models” predict a dependent variable (\\(Y\\)) from multiple independent variables (\\(X\\)s). These are alternately called “prediction algorithms,” “prognostic models,” “forecasting models,” or “screening algorithms.”\nWhen developing these tools, the main use-case we had in mind was that in which the \\(X\\)s temporally precede the \\(Y\\) (i.e., predicting from now into the future). However, the tools could also be used for predicting a \\(Y\\) that is measured concurrently to the \\(X\\)s.\n\n\nWhy focus on “survey-based” predictors? (NEED TO RE-WORK THIS PARAGRAPH TO “WHY FOCUS ON RISK SCORES”)\nHere, the prediction models are “survey-based” because they only use predictors (\\(X\\)s) that could be measured via a single survey question.\nWe exclude other measurement modalities (e.g., brain imaging, neuropsychological testing, interviewer impressions) because at present they are too expensive, time-consuming, and/or logistically challenging for widespread implementation.\nIt is difficult to get professionals and systems to use even basic, survey-based screening algorithms — let alone to collect and integrate multimodal data to feed such an algorithm.\nHere, we focus on relatively brief, low-burden, survey-based assessments that are suitable for widespread deployment in applied settings (e.g., schools, clinics, communities).\n\n\nWhat are the “tools” you offer here?\nThe tools included on this website are:\n\nCode to create a tidy dataframe with 2,742 individual survey items to use as predictors (\\(X\\)s) in prediction models (one click)\nMetadata for the 2,742 individual survey items that can be used to guide selection of which to use as predictors (e.g., to identify those measuring similar concepts)\n\nCreating and evaluating a predictive model has a few steps:\n\nChoose what to predict (\\(Y\\))\nChoose the predictors (\\(X\\)s)\nCreate an algorithm that takes values on the predictors (\\(X\\)s) as inputs and gives a score (\\(\\hat{Y}\\)s) as the output\nEvaluate the performance of the algorithm created in #3 along a set of predictive performance metrics\n\nWhen the dataset is fixed, like ABCD, then #2 becomes the most time-consuming step.\n\n\nI want to create a survey-based prediction model: how do I get started?\nFirst, you’ll need access to the ABCD Study 6.0 data — that is only available [directly from the NIH].\nSecond, download the code repository [abcd-itembuild]. This code will take the ABCD Study 6.0 data and create a tidy dataframe with individual survey items ready to plug into a predictive model.\nThird, reference our preprint to see how to develop a screening measure for prospective prediction of high-risk outcomes from late childhood (ages 9-10) to mid-adolescence (ages 15-16)."
